# Fallout Alaska
 
As a request from the Fallout Alaska community founder, I was told I can give away our schema to the general public. This is the base version that currently includes the plugins that are not from my authory, as those are private and sold individually.

Currently, this version has:

A fully working pipboy;
Stormfox;
Perks;
Custom Character Creation (like lazarus);
Custom Crafting;;
Teleporters;
Weapon Tweaks;
Anti Exploits;
Custom animations;
Skills;
Leveling;
Looting System;



The custom version I am selling also includes:

Different voice tones you can use on voice chat;
Airdrops;
Casino Kit;
A Custom ESC Menu;
Farming;
Handcuffs and Leashes;
Party Systems;
Custom Armor System;
Anti Crashes/Anti Exploits;
Attribute based vision range;
Stamina Effects;
Faction Management stuff;
Watermarks;
Drugs;
Radiation;
Attribute Rolling;
Limb Severng;
Controllable Points;
Mining;
Vending Machines;
FEV transformer items;
Car Vendors;
Food System;
Set of custom libraries that improve perfomance, experience and other things;


If you are looking to buy the custom version, DM me on my discord: Barata#8494

The base version works pretty well if you are starting off, but if you are looking for something deeper and more complex, I'd advice the custom version.
